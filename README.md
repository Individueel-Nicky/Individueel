## 1. Introduction

Welcome to my software development portfolio! I'm Nicky Tabrizifar and currently in my third semester at Fontys ICT & Software Engineering. This portfolio showcases how I have gone through the learning outcomes using my recent work, including research reports, individual and group projects, and reflections on my learning journey. I hope you enjoy reading through my work, and please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss a project.
